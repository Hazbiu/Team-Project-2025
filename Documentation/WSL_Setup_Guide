# WSL Setup Guide for Project Scripts

This guide explains how to properly set up WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) so that project scripts like `run_build.sh` and `build.sh` run without errors such as:

```bash
-bash: ./build.sh: cannot execute: required file not found
````

By following these steps, you’ll make sure your helper scripts work smoothly inside WSL — without Windows line-ending or permission issues.

---

## Create a folder for local WSL helpers

Open your WSL terminal and run:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/wsl_helpers
```

---

## Move the helper script to your local WSL helpers folder

```bash
mv /mnt/.../.../Team-Project-2025/src/run_build.sh ~/wsl_helpers/
```

> **Note:** Replace the `...` with your actual path.
> `/mnt/*driver*/...` is your Windows path.
> `~/wsl_helpers/` is your Linux home directory.

---

## Make the script executable

```bash
chmod +x ~/wsl_helpers/run_build.sh
```

---

## Open your shell configuration file

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

---

## Add the helpers folder to your PATH

At the very end of `.bashrc`, add:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/wsl_helpers:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

---

## Reload your shell configuration

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

---

## Test the script

```bash
run_build.sh
```

---

## Troubleshooting: Missing OpenSSL headers

If you see an error like this while running `./build.sh`:

```text
primary_bootloader.c:3:10: fatal error: openssl/evp.h: No such file or directory
   3 | #include <openssl/evp.h>
     |          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
compilation terminated.
```

Install the OpenSSL development library:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y libssl-dev
```

Then rerun your build:

```bash
./build.sh
```

---

## Full Test — Simulate a fresh start

Navigate to your project and reset line endings to simulate a Windows clone:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Programming/Team-Project-2025/src
unix2dos *.sh 2>/dev/null || echo "unix2dos not installed — skip"
```

Now test that the problem appears again:

```bash
./build.sh
```

You should see:

```bash
-bash: ./build.sh: cannot execute: required file not found
```

---

## Run helper setup

```bash
run_build.sh
```

It should:

* Install `dos2unix` if missing
* Convert all `.sh` files in the project to Unix line endings
* Make them executable

If it runs without errors, everything is configured correctly.
